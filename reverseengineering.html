	  <div class="body"><i>Team of 4 | 4 weeks | 2017</i></div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">A team of four were given one week to analyse and reverse engineer a Ninja Blender Duo, understanding its design features and inferring its method of manufacturing, assembly and developing a cost estimation. </div>
	  <div id="blender"></div>
	  <div class="body">The blender was disassembled and design features and clues to manufacturing processes noted, before it was sectioned for a display.</div>
	  <div id="display1"></div>
	  <div id="display2"></div>
	  <div class="body">I created a mock app which Ninja could use to help users gain more from their product, including a leaderboard and recipe sharing platform.</div>
	  <div id="healthleaderboard"></div>
	  <div id="recipebook"></div>
	  <div class="body">Interesting design features were noted, understood and sketched.</div>
	  <div id="lid"></div>
	  <div id="lock"></div>
	  <div id="drainpipe"></div>
	  <div id="buttons"></div>
	  <div class="body">The team then brainstormed and developed alternative industries which Ninja could enter using their existing technology. I sketched concepts such as a mobility scooter, washing machine for small dwellings and DIY cement mixer. </div>
	  <div id="washingmachine"></div>
	  <div id="cementmixer"></div>
	  <div id="mobilityscooter"></div>
	  <div class="body">Another concept, a laboritory centrifuge for experiments such as seperating DNA, had significant promise as current market offerings cost in excess of Â£800 for similar functionality as the blender. I developed a prototype centrifuge for demonstration to Ninja engineers and a manager.</div>
	  <div id="centrifuge1"></div>
	  <div id="centrifuge2"></div>
	  <div class="body">The centrifuge prototype was build and programmed in two days. It featured a microswitch used as an interlock, which would prevent the shaft turning if the lid was open. Once the lid was shut the user could increase or decrease the rotational speed. All of this information was displayed on a screen, and controlled by an Arduino using C++.</div>
