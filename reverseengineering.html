	  <div class="body">A team of four were given one week to analyse and reverse engineer a Ninja Blender Duo, understanding its design features and inferring its method of manufacturing, assembly and developing a cost estimation. </div>
	  <div id="blender"></div>
	  <div class="body">The blender was disassembled and design features and clues to manufacturing processes noted, before it was sectioned for a display.</div>
	  <div id="display1"></div>
	  <div id="display2"></div>
	  <div class="body">I created a mock app which Ninja could use to help users gain more from their product, including a leaderboard and recipe sharing platform.</div>
	  <div id="healthleaderboard"></div>
	  <div id="recipebook"></div>
	  <div class="body">Interesting design features were noted, understood and sketched.</div>
	  <div id="lid"></div>
	  <div id="lock"></div>
	  <div id="drainpipe"></div>
	  <div id="buttons"></div>
	  <div class="body">The team then brainstormed and developed alternative industries which Ninja could enter using their existing technology. I sketched concepts such as a mobility scooter, washing machine for small dwellings and DIY cement mixer. </div>
	  <div id="washingmachine"></div>
	  <div id="cementmixer"></div>
	  <div id="mobilityscooter"></div>
	  <div class="body">Another concept, a laboritory centrifuge for experiments such as seperating DNA, had significant promise as current market offerings cost in excess of Â£800 for similar functionality as the blender. I developed a prototype centrifuge for demonstration to Ninja engineers and a manager.</div>
