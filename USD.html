	  <div class="body">I took part in a two-week design project supported by disability charity <a href="http://designability.org.uk/">Designability</a> to identify and propose improvements to supermarket self-checkout machines, making them more accessible for stroke survivors. This began by interviewing a man who had suffered a stroke two years prior, and brainstorming the issues he faced using self checkouts.</div>
	  <div id="USDbrainstorm"></div>
	  <div class="body">The aspects he struggled with were then summarised, allowing relevant concepts to be generated.</div>
	  <div id="USDConceptMap"></div>
	  <div class="body">Concepts were then evaluated using Multi-Criteria Decision analysis against Designability's criteria.</div>
	  <div id="USDevaluation"></div>
	  <div class="body">The concept that was pursued set out to simplify the structure of the payment task by carrying out all interactions in one location, and to be operable with one hand. This was explored in detail.</div>
	  <div id="USDdetail"></div>
	  <div class="body">This led to the creation of numerous quick cardboard prototypes, which were tested by the user, providing a final design direction.</div>
	  <div id="USDprototyping"></div>
	  <div id="USDprototype"></div>
	  <div class="body">A final prototype was then created using rapid prototyping.</div>
