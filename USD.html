	  <div class="subheading">User-Centred Design Project: Inclusive Self-Checkout</div>
	  <div class="body"><i>Team of 2 | 3 weeks | 2017</i></div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">I took part in a two-week design project supported by disability charity <a href="http://designability.org.uk/">Designability</a> to identify and propose improvements to supermarket self-checkout machines, making them more accessible for stroke survivors. This began by interviewing a man who had suffered a stroke two years prior, and brainstorming the issues he faced using self checkouts.</div>
	  <div id="USDbrainstorm"></div>
	  <div class="body">The aspects he struggled with were then summarised, allowing relevant concepts to be generated.</div>
	  <div id="USDConceptMap"></div>
	  <div class="body">Concepts were then evaluated using Multi-Criteria Decision analysis against Designability's criteria.</div>
	  <div id="USDevaluation"></div>
	  <div class="body">The concept that was pursued set out to simplify the structure of the payment task by carrying out all interactions in one location, and to be operable with one hand. This was explored in detail.</div>
	  <div id="USDdetail"></div>
	  <div class="body">This led to the creation of numerous quick cardboard prototypes, which were tested by the user, providing a final design direction.</div>
	  <div id="USDprototyping"></div>
	  <div id="USDprototype"></div>
	  <div class="body">The pivoting handle was a key component and was modelled using Autodesk Fusion 360, taking into account ergonomic data to ensure an inclusive sizing.</div>
	  <div id="UCDcad"></div>
	  <div class="body">The final prototype was then created using rapid prototyping.</div>
	  <div id="USDfinalprototype"></div>
	  <div class="body">A storyboard shows the method with which the user would interact with the design.</div>
	  <div id="USDstoryboard"></div>
	  <div class="body">(1) The product would allow the user to place his wallet on the table</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">(2) This would aid his ability to gather, pick and place coins</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class-"body">(3) The user could slide coins into the machine one at a time or lift the handle, which requires less dexterity than a sideways slot.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">(4) The machine would process and return the correct change to the same tray, simplifying the number of places the user needs to pay attention to.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">(5-6) The user could then gather all his change into the palm of his hand in one motion, rather than picking individual coins with one hand.</div
