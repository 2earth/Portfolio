	  <div class="subheading">Code and Programming</div>
	  <div class="body">As a child I had a few interactions with programming, mostly through gaming. This took a new turn when I taught myself <a href="./arduino.html">Arduino</a> in the summer after my A-levels, and since then I have learned a number of programming languages to differing levels.</div>

	  <div class="subheading" id="MSH">MATLAB</div>
	  <div class="body">My most confident language, I've used MATLAB extensively during university. </div>
	  <div id="mechatronicsflow"></div>
	  <div class="body">My largest MATLAB project was a <a href="./mechatronics.html">mechatronics design project</a> in which I wrote all the code. The hardware would scan a rectangular area for magnets, then detect and optimise a path to seek each one. </div>
	  <div id="halldata"></div>
	  <div class="body">The raw data collected by moving the rig and taking voltage readings from a hall-effect sensor needed to be processed to return reliable data.</div>
	  <div id="gantry"></div>
	  <div class="body">When moving the gantry up or down a lightgate was used to detect stalls, preventing misalignment. When rotating the gears a continuous rotary potentiometer was used to operate the DC motor in closed-loop feedback, allowing accurate and precise position control.</div>
	  <div id="tileprocess"></div>
	  <div class="body">In my second year I worked on an individual project to model the heat transfer through an insulating tile on a space shuttle during re-entry. This required the integration of heat transfer and modelling techniques theory with practical coding skills.</div>
	  <div id="tileGUI"></div>
	  <div class="body">The final code modelled the heat transfer across time and through the tile's thickness, allowing the user to alter parameters within a graphical user interface (GUI) to observe effects. It also allowed the user to set a maximum inner surface temperature and use the shooting method to identify the required thickness of tile.</div>
	  <div id="parceltrajectory"></div>
	  <div class="body">In my first year I created a program which modelled the trajectory of a 'parcel' fired at a certain angle and speed, and with a parachute being deployed to reduce the surface impact speed. Once more, the shooting method was used to calculate the initial conditions required to impact a target.</div>
	  <div id="springdamperfv"></div>
	  <div class="body">In my first year I conducted a practical laboratory experiment, collecting data from a mountain bike spring-damper suspension system. This data was plotted in MATLAB to support theoretical conclusions.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="subheading" id="CPPSH">C++</div>
	  <div class="body">In my free time I have created a number of small <a href="./arduino.html">Arduino</a> projects, all of which have been programmed using C++. An example of this is a <a href=./"reverseengineering.html">prototype laboritory centrifuge</a> I built and programmed in two days. </div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div id="centrifuge2"></div>
	  <div class="body">the centrifuge had a microswitch used as an interlock, which would prevent the shaft turning if the lid was open. Once the lid was shut the user could increase or decrease the rotational speed. All of this information was displayed on a screen.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="subheading" id="CSSHTMLSH">CSS and HTML</div>
	  <div class="body">I learned Css and HTML from online tutorials to allow me to produce a demonstration website I created for my <a href="./GBDP.html>">group business and design project</a>.</div>
	  <div id="jdfweb"></div>
	  <div>I then expanded my skills by creating this website, entirely without a template. A small amount of javascript was involved for dynamic elements.</div>
	  <div id="tt2"></div>
	  <div class="body">In my first year I worked in a team of 6 to design a table tennis ball launcher, which would fire 6 balls across the width of a table. I produced the CAD assembly using Siemens Solid Edge ST6.
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="subheading" id="PYSH">Python</div>
	  <div class="body">I have used python for small self-motivated projects.</div>
	  <div id="projectilepython"></div>
	  <div class="body">In this program, I modelled the trajectory of a projectile based on values input by the user, and then drew a graph of this line by line using ASCII characters. While unnecesarily novel, this created some interesting programming challenges to solve, for example auto-scaling the axis markers.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="subheading" id="GSH">Git</div>
	  <div class="body">To support creating this website, I learned the basics of the standard version control system, Git.</div>
	  <div id="gitimage"></div>
	  <div class="body">In a larger scale programming project where multiple people were contributing code, version control would be essential to manage changes.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="subheading" id="LVSH">Labview</div>
	  <div class="body">I used the graphical programming language Labview to <a href="LEGONXT.html">control a LEGO NXT</a> which solved a maze autonomously.</div>
	  <div id="NXTforwards"></div>
	  <div class="body">This involved using familiar coding structures such as <i>if</i> and <i>while</i> loops, as well as <i>boolean</i> and <i>logical</i> tests. Shown above is the code to ensure the robot followed a black line.</div>
	  <div id="optimisepath"></div>
	  <div class="body">The unique part of the code was as the robot navigated the maze it stored a record of movements, encoded by an absolute "compass". This string was then searched for contradictory movements which would represent a dead-end, leaving the robot with a shortest path which it followed to the start point. This is shown above.</div>
