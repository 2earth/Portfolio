	  <div class="body">Having spent the first two years studying general mechanical engineering, I made the decision to specialise in Integrated Design Engineering. This was primarily because I wanted a program that focussed more on practical project work, allowing greater creativity and requiring a broad set of skills, including programming, electronics and problem solving. I'm now in a group of 16 students taking the course.</div>
