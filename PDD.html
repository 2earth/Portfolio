	  <div class="subheading">Sustainable Toys</div>
	  <div class="body">A third year university project was to design a product which would address the brief of sustainable toys posed by the <a href="https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/design/student-design-awards/news-and-events/2016-17-awards-ceremony-with-keynote-by-david-constantine">RSA</a>. The purpose of the project was also to place a focus on the design tools and methodology utilised. Working in a group of four, I led the final stage of the design, converging the concept space, drawing the concepts and selecting a final concept.</div>
	  <div id="ProcessDiagram"></div>
	  <div class="body">This was done using Pugh's controlled convergence method, which allowed a concept addition phase after each round of selection.</div>
	  <div id="Pugh"></div>
	  <div class="body">Concepts were ranked as better, the same as or worse than the datum design.</div>
	  <div id="fantasykit"></div>
	  <div class="body">My concept the <i>fantasy kit</i> responded to cognitive development research by allowing young children to create their own "fantasy" environment in which to play socially in an unprescripted manner.</div>
	  <div id="craftkit"></div>
	  <div class="body">My second concept, the <i>craft kit</i> aimed to facilitate childrens' natural creativity, using "found" or upcycled objects when possible. The space would live and develop with the child.</div>
	  <div id="natura"></div>
	  <div class="body">The <i>natura</i> concept featured a 360Â° projector which would transform a child's room into an exciting play area. Children could draw or create environments to play in on a tablet or smart device.</div>
	  <div id="wonderland"></div>
	  <div class="body">The robot arm needed to be sturdy but also easy to assemble.</div>
	  <div id="immersivefantasy"></div>
	  <div class="body">The <i>immersive fantasy</i> concept used auditory prompts to loosely guide children through a game scenario, suggesting they use household objects to improvise elements of the game.</div>
	  <div id="fantasynatura"></div>
	  <div class="body">The final concept <i>fantasy natura</i> integrated the strengths of different ideas into an immersive projected environment which improvised elements from household and found objects. Shown here, children play together to defend their ship from sharks on their way to dig for pirate treasure. This addressed the brief by replacing ephemeral plastic toys with an exciting play environment which would develop childrens' social and creative skills.</div>
