	  <div class="body">During my year working at MG in Birmingham it was my responsibility to redesign the project car's brake system. This included the brake pedal, booster, master cylinder, brake lines, callipers, disks, wheel speed sensors, ABS, wheels and tyres. Initially, I disassembled the MGB's wheel corners.</div>
	  <div id="Disassembly"></div>
	  <div class="body">Next, I used a 3D scanner to generate CAD data to support a packaging feasibility study.</div>
	  <div id="Scan"></div>
	  <div class="body">Once a design was found which enabled disks, callipers and wheels to be mounted within the existing body, on the existing wheel hubs, an FEA model was used to ensure re-drilling the new disks would be safe at max braking force.</div>
	  <div id="FEA"></div>
	  <div class="body">A significant challenge was fitting a Bosch ABS kit. Wheel speed sensors from a BMW were fitted to bespoke toothed rings. A custom bracket mounted the rear callipers, replacing the standard car's drum brakes.</div>
	  <div id="WSS"></div>
	  <div class="body">The completed brakes had the appearance and performance of the exciting demonstrator vehicle MG wanted to create.</div>
