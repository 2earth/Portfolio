	  <div class="body"><i>Team of 2 | 3 months | 2018</i></div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">Working for a well-established client with a small team, I designed and built an automated gantry system including mechanical, electronic and programmed aspects.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">While the project's sensitivity prevents discussion of the broader project aims, I helped brainstorm high-level concepts with the team. We summarised our thinking into 7 unique streams, and studied the feasibility of each before presenting to the client.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">The preferred design required a CNC gantry as a key subsystem, which I opted to take responsibility for.
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">Once this design direction was confirmed, development progressed to a functional level. Using quick, low-fidelity prototypes to support decision making, I sketched a number of alternative gantry layouts.</div>
	  <div id="layoutsketch"></div>
	  <div class="body">Further details were explored with the objective of building and testing a proof-of-principle functional prototype in a short timescale.</div>
	  <div id="zaxisdev"></div>

	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">In parallel with design development sketches, a fully comprehensive CAD model was produced.</div>
	  <div id="cadannotated"></div>
	  <div class="body">The design used lightweight and inexpensive construction methods which could be rapidly prototyped and altered. Stepper motors were used to provide discrete actuation and were controlled by an Arduino via MATLAB through serial link, with appropriately chosen motor controllers and a power supply supporting the prototype.</div>
	  <div id="wiringdiagram"></div>
	  <div class="body">The electronic system was designed at the same time as the mechanical system to ensure successful integration. The key components are:</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">1   Stepper motors</div>
	  <div class="body">2   Power supply</div>
	  <div class="body">3   Motor controllers</div>
	  <div class="body">4   Prototype circuit</div>
	  <div class="body">5   Arduino microcontroller</div>
	  <div class="body">6   PC running MATLAB program</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div id="gantryphoto"></div>
	  <div class="body">The final prototype was highly successful in achieving open-loop, reliable coordinate control in three axes supported by embedded C code and tethered MATLAB code. Requested coordinate GCODE could be executed to create the desired motion path.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">Hardware integration with the broader system was not tested before completion of the project, however the client warmly received the final demonstration and was satisfied that the project's TRL had progressed sufficiently to be directly funded and supported inhouse. The final handover included a roadmap for future development and speculative end-goal sketches, which are of a business-sensitive nature.</div>
