	  <div class="body">The team were tasked with designing a workshop including the Dyson 360 eye, a wirelessly controlled robotic vacuum cleaner.</div>
	  <div id="dysonrobot"></div>
	  <div class="body">The James Dyson Foundation would distribute the kit to state secondary schools free of charge, to inspire year 7-11 students and promote science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers. The proposed workshop comprises a challenge-based activity with a competitive aspect, where students would work in teams of 5-6.</div>
	  <div id="vis"></div>
	  <div class="body">Students would aim to complete four robot games themed challenges to earn table-tennis balls, allowing them extra shots at the final basket challenge.</div>
	  <div id="challenges"></div>
	  <div class="body">The Dyson 360 eye robot and attachments would be programmed to solve challenges via a tablet, using graphical programming language Google Blockly.</div>
	  <div id="app"></div>
	  <div class="body">My role was the design development of a robot arm, gripper attachment and ball launcher which fit into the robot alongside a base and cover.</div>
	  <div id="conceptdevelopment"></div>
	  <div id="grippersassembly"></div>
	  <div class="body">The grippers were made from as few lasercut pieced of MDF as possible.</div>
	  <div id="launcherexploded"></div>
	  <div class="body">The launcher's dimensions needed to be very specific to allow the trigger to function correctly.</div>
	  <div id="robotarmexploded"></div>
	  <div class="body">The robot arm needed to be sturdy but also easy to assemble.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">The final designs intend to be fun, interesting and easy to assemble, while permitting all bespoke components to be manufactured from low-volume production techniques using Dyson’s existing facilities.</div>
	  <div id="explodedkit"></div>
	  <div class="body">The final prototype has a friendly appearance and impressive performance given exclusive use of lasercut MDF and 3D printed parts, costing £61 including actuators.</div>
	  <div id="GBDP2robots"></div>
	  <div class="body">The head of computing at Beechen Cliff Highschool in Bath stated she would be “very excited” to use the product in her lessons.</div>
	  <div id="jdfweb"></div>
	  <div class="body">To enrich the project, I learned CSS and HTML from online tutorials to allow me to produce a demonstration website for the scheme.</div>
