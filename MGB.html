	  <div class="subheading">MGB 'Reboot'</div>
	  <div class="body">While on placement at MG, the seven interns were tasked with restoring and updating a classic MGB, using as many modern MG components as possible. The vehicle was a 1969 MGB GT, purchased for Â£2000.</div>
	  <div id="carreveal"></div>
	  <div class="body">The team produced a timing plan for the project, including tasks from benchmarking and feasibility studies to detailed design, building and debugging.</div>
	  <div id="timingplan"></div>
	  <div class="body">Once performance targets were set, the car disassembly began, removing the entire power and drivetrains, braking and steering systems.</div>
	  <div id="engineremoval"></div>
	  <div class="body">To allow detailed packaging studies to be carried out in CAD, key areas of the vehicle were scanned to generate a point cloud.</div>
	  <div id="scanning"></div>
	  <div class="body">Progressively subsystems were packaged and required body modifications were made to integrate the new systems. The entire vehicle was cleaned and the paint stripped, with the chrome strip removed and the vehicle was sprayed with British racing green paint.</div>
	  <div id="displayfront"></div>
	  <div class="body">The completed vehicle featured electric power steering (EPS), anti-lock brakes (ABS), a 2.0 litre turbo-charged petrol engine, ventilated disk brakes front and rear, 16" rims and lower-profile, 6.5" tyres.</div>
	  <div id="displayside"></div>
	  <div class="body">Since completion and presentation to the company, the vehicle has been touring events including the BTCC at Silverstone and the classic car show at the Birmingham NEC. The project has also been featured in articles in the MG Car Club (MGCC) and University of Bath Engineering and Design magazines.</div>
