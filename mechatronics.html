	  <div class="body">The team was tasked to develop a mechatronic system in three weeks that would interface with an X-Y gantry to identify magnets and place a plastic cup on each.</div>
	  <div id="gantry"></div>
	  <div class="body">A mechanical design which could collect, store and place cups without modification was sketched.</div>
	  <div id="mechatronicssketch"></div>
	  <div class="body">To locate magnets, the design scanned across the area and gathered data representing the magnetic field strength using a hall-effect sensor. This was processed and the magnets were located using MATLAB.</div>
	  <div id="mechatronicsdata"></div>
	  <div class="body">Each of the actuators and sensors were controlled by a bespoke shield for the Arduino Mega.</div>
	  <div id="finalwiringdiagram"></div>
	  <div class="body">The final design scanned the area using a hall-effect sensor, collecting cups using a DC motor closed-loop controlled by a continuous potentiometer. Vertical actuation was achieved using a stepper motor, with stalls being detected by a light-gate acting as a simple encoder.</div>
