	  <div class="body">While working in the trim department at MG I was asked to generate ideas that would challenge the dominant automotive seating design, featuring two linear rails to adjust forward positioning. First, I brainstormed concepts.</div>
	  <div id="seatbrainstorm"></div>
	  <div class="body">I presented each concept to my team who each ranked the concepts against agreed criteria. I then used Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to evaluate the most promising direction.</div>
	  <div id="seatevaluation"></div>
	  <div class="body">I then developed the chosen concept, which featured one rail mounted above the transmission tunnel and one under a false floor. A CAD model was produced to support a detailed design.</div>
	  <div id="seatCAD"></div>
	  <div class="body">Following this I supplied designer Paolo Liuzzi with my CAD model, who produced a series of professional concept drawings to support my design.</div>
	  <div id="seatconceptangle"></div>
	  <div id="seatconceptside"></div>
	  <div class="body">I then presented my design progress to the head of Vehicle Engineering, who awarded budget to the project to support a prototype. Further detailed design supported by my seating colleagues, followed by procurement, led to a building phase.</div>
	  <div id="seatwelding"></div>
	  <div class="body">I manufactured as much of the final prototype as possible, following my own engineering drawings. The seat could be locked or slid forward after pulling a lever as per the standard design. However, the seat rails were hidden from view behind tambour in the transmission tunnel and under a false floor. This could allow improved ergonomics or storage possiblities.</div>
