	  <div class="body">My final university project remanufactures unwanted high-quality postconsumer clothing into attractive and varied pieces of patchwork fabric, for diverse end applications. By doing so it aims to mitigate the numerous impacts resulting from the global consumption of clothing, and to raise awareness of the problem.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div id="complete_patchwork"></div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">A short essay summarising my concerns on the topic can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="./tr essay.html">here</a>.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">My first piece of work studied the environmental problems resulting from clothing consumption. I found that the production of cotton clothing is energy, water and chemical intense, with broader ecological and biodiversity concerns stemming from farming practices.</div>
	  <div id="trprimaryenergy"></div>
	  <div id="trendoflife"></div>
	  <div class="body">My study also found that clothing is short-lived in the UK, with an average use phase of 3.3 years. The disposal of unwanted clothing creates another huge challenge, with an uncomfortable quantity being landfilled or incinerated.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">This research confirmed my project's direction as a recycling initiative, as by producing new products from reclaimed material impacts incurred at production and disposal would be avoided.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">After conducting a group brainstorm to identify and segment as many applications for textiles as possible, I carried out a social media study to confirm which items are most frequently produced using patchwork.</div>
	  <div id="trbrainstormapplications"></div>
	  <div id="trsocialmedia"></div>
	  <div class="body">I then identified uses with high potential for the project using a 2D criteria map. The items which were eventually selected were tote bags, technology cases and pencil cases, shopping bags, mats/ rugs and quilts.</div>
	  <div id="trapplications"></div>
	  <div class="body">My second investigative report researched the academic and industrial attempts at automated sewing. The research was split into areas of <i>sensing techniques</i>, <i>handling mechanisms</i>, <i>material properties</i> and <i>control methods</i>. It was found that modern advancements in computing have enabled more sophisticated vision and control techniques. Most research aims towards automated garment manufacture, but the project differs from this challenge in that only linear sewn profiles are required.</div>
	  <div id="trbrother"></div>
	  <div id="trvetron"></div>
	  <div class="body">Left: <i>Brother Vision Sewing System</i>	Right: <i>Vetron AutoSeam prototype</i></div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">I conducted a series of experiments to broadly categorise the material properties of different fabrics likely to be encountered. A tensile test rig was built to support the experiments.</div>
	  <div id="trtensileexperiment"></div>
	  <div id="trtensilephoto"></div>
	  <div class="body">The experiments observed highly non-linear and anisotrophic material properties, particularly in knitted fabrics. This data and understanding will be used during prototyping to maintain applied forces to appropriate levels.</div> 
	  <div id="trtensilegraph1"></div>
	  <div id="trtensilegraph2"></div>
	  <div class="body">Left: <i>Knitted sample, showing non-linear and anisotropic behaviour</i><p></p>Right: <i>Woven sample, showing linear and isotropic behaviour</i></div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">Design development of the system was informed by these research reports, and after brainstorming key decisions were made regarding stitch type and manufacturing layout were made.</div>
	  <div id="trstitch"></div>
	  <div id="trcell"></div>
	  <div class="body">The overlock sewing process was selected to give produced patchwork the best quality finish. A 'workbench' manufacturing strategy, where the fabric would be produced in situ, was originally considered, however a 'cell' based strategy, where operations would be conducted separately, was selected to reduce complexity and increase cycle time.</div>
	  <p></p>
	  <div class="body">Alternative options were considered for manipulation, sensing and control and due to the system complexity a morphological chart was used to identify different concepts.</div>
	  <div id="trearlyconcepts"></div>
	  <div class="body">To investigate the feasibility of manipulating fabric using suction, a low-fidelity prototype was made. Powered by a domestic vacuum, this performed unexpectedly well, and offered confidence that patches could be lifted if required.</div>
	  <div id="trsuction"></div>
	  <div class="body">Different manipulations options were explored to support actions required of the system.</div>
	  <div id="trmanipulation"></div>
	  <div class="body">I used machine vision to reliably recognise the position of fabric patches and identify their centre and angle. This was used to support pick-and-place operations.</div>
	  <div id="trmachinevision"></div>
	  <div class="body">The mechanical system was developed in iterative design, prototyping and testing cycles. The overall system was split into sub-functions, which were developed individually but with reference to the broader system.</div>
	  <div id="trdevelopment"></div>
	  <div class="body">Electronic development progressed simultaneously to control the sewing machine and introduce elements of automation.</div>
	  <div id="elecdevtextile"></div>
	  <div class="body">As the sub-systems approached completion, integration was necessary. This was done with respect to both mechanical and electronic considerations, to ensure the success of the entire mechatronic system.</div>
	  <div id="integration"></div>
	  <div class="body">The final system was able to sew rows of patchwork autonomously, delivering a strong proof-of-principle and allowing fundamental parameters of the system to be studied.</div>
	  <div id="full_system"></div>
	  <div class="body">Due to the success of the project I produced an academic paper relating to the study; as part of which I studied the material utilisation and carbon savings possible using this technique. The paper is currently being reviewed and will be linked when published.</div>
	  <div id="calculations_textile"></div>
	  <div class="body">While there are currently no plans to develop the system further, it stands as a demonstration of how a circular economy vision can be combined with a business model and eco-design to produce a novel technique.</div>
